    "The government or a research organization wants to predict the CO2 emissions of vehicles based on their attributes (e.g., engine size, weight, fuel type, model year). This could help policymakers create regulations for reducing CO2 emissions, or consumers could use this information to select vehicles with lower emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcome\n",
    "- A model that accurately predicts CO2 emissions based on vehicle features.\n",
    "- Insights into which vehicle attributes (like engine size, fuel type, or weight) are the most important predictors."
